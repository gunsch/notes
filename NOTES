Some ideas, not sure on ordering importance:

* need a deploy story.

* figure out Service Workers. how do they work, what do they do.

* figure out how to cache app offline with Service Workers.

* data store offline with JS abstraction (are Service Workers involved?).
  store basic note text and restore on reload.

* Text thoughts: running log. load at bottom.
  Big button for moving onto next thing?

* Polymer components or something

* Some sort of JS tests / test framework. Runnable without browser (ideally?).
  Travis CI?

* storing in Drive instead of in local store.


Random UI thoughts:

* Swipe from left for side menu. No visual indicators on main view not about
  the text itself.

* Separate settings screen? Put everything into side menu for now?

* Menu item: toggle for recording geolocation (low priority)
* Menu item: toggle for showing metadata next to text (lower priority)
* Menu item: search
